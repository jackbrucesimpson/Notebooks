    "A benefit of using this dataset is that it is a standard benchmark problem. This means that we have some idea of the expected skill of a good model. Using cross validation, a neural network should be able to achieve performance around 84% with an upper bound on accuracy for custom models at around 88%."

    "It is a good practice to prepare your data before modeling for neural network models, which need consistent input values, both in scale and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective data preparation scheme for tabular data when building neural network models is standardization. This is where the data is rescaled such that the mean value for each attribute is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This preserves Gaussian and Gaussian-like distributions whilst normalizing the central tendencies for each attribute. We can use scikit-learn to perform the standardization of our Sonar dataset using the StandardScaler class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than performing the standardization on the entire dataset, it is good practice to train the standardization procedure on the training data within the pass of a cross validation run and to use the trained standardization to prepare the “unseen” test fold. This makes standardization a step in model preparation in the cross validation process and it prevents the algorithm having knowledge of “unseen” data during evaluation, knowledge that might be passed from the data preparation scheme like a crisper distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can achieve this in scikit-learn using a Pipeline. The pipeline is a wrapper that executes one or more models within a pass of the cross validation procedure. Here, we can define a pipeline with the StandardScaler followed by our neural network model."
